        int myInt;          // A data type of "int" is used to store a numerical character that does not have a decimal. In other words an whole number.Ranges are:  from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
        long myLongNumber;  // A Long also stores whole numbers but from an even wider range: From -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
        float myFloatNumber // A float stores fractional numbers ufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits.
        double myDoubleNum; // A double stores fractional numbers ufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.

        //It is important to get used to using the correct data type that we need. Although it might not make a difference to use an int or a short instead of a byte, keeping good practices could help us in the long run when we actually
        //start to think about our memory efficiency.
